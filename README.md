## Overview

Packr is a chrome extension for beautifully managing your tabs.

- **Easy to use**

> Packr is design to maximize user experience by reducing the interface down to the necessary elements.

- **Save big on RAM**

> With Packr, you can pack your tabs into groups, allowing you to reopen them with a single click. This allows you to save the RAM all those open Chrome windows are consuming. You are also able to edit invidual packs by adding/removing tabs.
